# - 203.101.226.44
#
# NOTE: this is required ONLY for the deployment part so ansible can use ssh without the
#       need for human user interaction (obviously - because this is an automated process).
#       If you for example want to use ansible to deploy into a vm, and then run some test
#       against that vm (for example to do some REST API test-s with curl) you do NOT need
#       a hostname here; but simply add something like:
#          - sudo sh -c "echo \"203.101.226.44  testhostname\" >> /etc/hosts"
#
#       to before_script: or to script: anywhere BEFORE your REST API tests
