# 1. If your project has build.gradle file in the repository root, gradle will
#    be used to build it; by default (if you do not provide script: section)
#    travis-ci will use:
#       gradle build connectedCheck
#
# 2. If your project also includes the gradlew wrapper script in the repo root,
#    travis will use the default command:
#       ./gradlew build connectedCheck
#
# OR create/add a script: section with your custom build command
